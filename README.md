# host-structPacketBitField
This project uses STM32CubeIDE and it's a program created to practice my C habilities during the course 'Microcontroller Embedded C Programming: Absolute Beginners' from FastBit Embedded Brain Academy.

This code improves the size of consumed memory by using the previus created packet in [host-structPacket](https://github.com/Rafaelatff/host-structPacket) project.

## Results
